(between 0 and 1)\nx = the number of Clovers in the player's inventory.\n\ny = new item proc chance (between 0 and 1) with x amount of Clovers.\n\nThe inverse of the equation, to find the number of Clovers required to achieve a certain proc probability, is:\nx = (log(1 - y) / log(1 - p)) - 1\nNote that this is a logarithmic equation.\n\nAs such, it is impossible to achieve 100% proc chance on an effect (regardless of the number of Clovers held), unless the base chance is already 100%.\n\nIn order to calculate proc probability with a certain number of Clovers and a certain number of times a proc chance is rolled, the following equation can be used:\ny = 1 - ((1 - p)^(x + 1))^t\nWhere:\n\np = total proc chance (between 0 and 1)\nx = the number of Clovers in the player's inventory.\n\nt = the amount of times a proc chance is rolled.\n\ny = new proc chance (between 0 and 1) with x amount of Clovers and t amount of times the proc chance is rolled.\n\nThis equation is useful for

Luck.\n\nNegative Luck is also supported, and can be obtained via the lunar item  PurityPurityReduce your skill cooldowns by 2 seconds.\n\nYou are unlucky.All skill cooldowns are reduced by 2 (+1 per

Purity will equate to 0 Luck.\n\nThe game runs a proc chance Abs(Luck) times, where Luck is the total amount after Clovers (positive) & Purities (negative) are applied.\n\nIf the player has 7 Clovers and 5 Purity, the 5 Purity will cancel out 5 of the Clovers, resulting in a net +2 Luck.\n\nThis means any given proc chance will be rolled two additional times for a positive outcome.\n\nIf the amount of each item is switched, resulting in -2 Luck, the proc chance will be rolled two additional times for a negative outcome; this can also be seen as the proc chance needing to successfully roll

the number of seconds over which the remaining credits will be awarded.\n\nFor common waves it is 30 seconds and for boss waves 60 seconds.\n\nWhile this places a minimum duration per wave, realistically this is limited by how quickly the director can spend the accumulated credits.\n\nThe immediateMonsterCredits is also what the director will use to set the first spawn of the boss wave to a boss monster.\n\nSuch a boss spawn will fail to materialise for at least the first couple of boss waves as there will be insufficient credits.\n\nMost notably, on wave 10 on Monsoon difficulty the director will initially have access to 599.19 credits, while the cheapest boss monster costs 600.\n\nSince there can be a maximum of 30 enemies spawned at once, the director stops accumulating credits when it hits the limit and resumes when at least one enemy has been killed.\n\nVersion History[]\nPC Patch v1.2.2.0\nSimulacrum\nWaves now skip if nothing has spawned for 60 seconds\nWaves now

to address situations where the game gets stuck.\n\nNot only that, but simulacrum tended to spam a lot more normal monsters instead of elites - so now, it’ll spawn a little bit more

calculating gold lost.\n\nIf the player has 100 health, 100 gold, and one Brittle Crown, using the Shrine of Blood for the first time will leave them with 75 gold.\n\nTaking 50% damage, they lose 50% of their gold, leaving them with 50 gold.\n\nThe shrine always gives 50% of the health taken as gold, so they then gain 25 gold.\n\nThe Brittle Crown subtracts gold based on the player's fullCombinedHealth, which is their maximum HP plus their maximum shields.\n\nThis is the same value that Shrines of Blood use, so as long as the player's fullCombinedHealth is more than two times

Rescue Ship protected by an unbreakable force field.\n\nTheir new objective will be to find a way to release the Rescue Ship in order to escape the planet.\n\nDifferent pillars are scattered around the stage, with a total of 4-7 pillars spawning.\n\nThe player's objective is to activate and charge (i.e.\n\ncomplete the holdout event) 4 of them in order to activate jump pads that will lead to   MithrixMithrixKing of NothingHP: 1000 (+300 per level)Damage: 16 (+3.2 per level)Class: Melee / RangedSpeed: 15 m/sArmor: 20, the final boss.\n\nThere are 4 different pillar areas, each having the potential of spawning up to 4 pillars with a radius of 20m and their unique way of charging:\n\nPillars of Mass take 60 seconds to charge, and have no special properties.\n\nPillars of Design take 30 seconds to charge and release shock waves during the process.","metadata":{}}],["171",{"pageContent":"Commencement --------------\n\nPillars of Design take 30 seconds to charge and release shock waves

by 20 and movement speed by 50%.\n\nThe shock waves can be avoided by repeatedly jumping.\n\nPillars of Soul take 30 seconds to charge, but their charging radius will shrink the more they charge.\n\nThe pillar's charge also rapidly decreases if all players leave the charging zone by 10% per second.\n\nPillars of Blood take 10 seconds to charge, but they absorb the health of the player in the process.\n\nThe pillar will drain 10% health per second (2.5% per tick, so it can be affected by the Eclipse 8 modifier), for a total of 100% over the charging duration.\n\nPillar of

have 3 minutes to get to the Rescue Ship and complete its holdout event in order to escape.\n\nThe event requires them to 'protect' the ship by staying within the surrounding zone for 1 minute.\n\nWalls of blue flames will appear, similar to those created by some of Mithrix's attacks.\n\nVoid ReaversVoid ReaverHP: 1900 (+570 per level)Damage: 12 (+2.4 per level)Class: Ranged /

the escape zone to 98%, killing a Void Reaver, dipping in the zone to charge it to 99%, and then dying to the Void Reaver's implosion.\n\nIf the player dies after charging the zone, but they don't have an item to revive themselves, the game will still count it as a win, which means the result is marked the moment the zone is fully charged and not when the screen has completely faded to white.\n\nAny deaths occuring during the fade-to-white will also not count towards the final report.\n\nCauldrons & Lunar Pods[]\nOn the left end side of the stage, near where the Pillars of Design

be lowered by this amount.\n\nThis was abandoned before the Early Access release because \"[crit heal] wasn't as cool as it sounded\".\n\n[1] The Corpsebloom still has the internal name 'CritHeal' as

weapon.\n\nThe text from the first game's logbook entry, \"until the 3rd edition arrives,\" as well as this game's updated entry adding that \"the second edition\" is \"getting a little old\" are digs at the long production time of the Half-Life series and Valve's seeming dislike of the number 3, going as far as making Half-Life 1, 2 and Half-Life 2: Episodes 1 and 2.\n\nBecause of this, Half-Life 3 has become a well-known point of humor on the internet joking about how it will never come out.\n\nThe logbook entry may also be a reference to the Pokémon anime, in which a pair of characters also named Jesse and James are thieves for the criminal organization known as Team Rocket.","metadata":{}}],["184",{"pageContent":"Damage --------------\n\nContents\n\n1 Inflicting Damage\n\n1.1 Critical

damage falloff discourage shooting from extreme ranges and reward accuracy with area of effect attacks.\n\nThere are two falloff models: a bullet falloff model and an area of effect (AoE) falloff model.\n\nBullet falloff is used for hitscan bullet attacks, such as   Double TapDouble Tap (Primary)Rapidly shoot an enemy for 100% damage.Survivor: Commando,   BurstBurst (Primary)Fire a shotgun

'Total' Damage[]\nBase damage and total damage are the two main damage types in Risk of Rain 2.\n\nBase damage scales specifically with the character's base damage value.\n\nFor instance, take   CommandoCommandoThe Commando is a jack-of-all-trades character that is reliable in all situations of the game.Class: RangedHP: 110 (+33 per level)Damage: 12 (+2.4 per level)Umbra: Cornered Gunslinger

bleeding deals 20% base damage per tick, so it will deal 20% x 12 = 2.4 points of damage per tick.\n\nThis tick damage is not affected by the attack that inflicts the bleeding; it only will deal more damage as Commando levels up and his base damage increases.\n\nTotal damage is used for on-hit items that generate bonus attacks.\n\nThese items scale with the strength of the attack that activates them.\n\nFor instance, take another level 1 Commando (still with a base damage of 12), and assume he has shot an enemy one time with   Phase RoundPhase Round (Secondary)Fire a piercing bullet for 300%

Version History\n5 Gallery\n6 Trivia\n\nNotes[]\nPlayers without the Death Mark will still deal bonus damage to marked enemies.\n\nMarked for Death counts the debuffs on an enemy at the moment an attack hits but before any debuffs are applied from that attack.\n\nThis means that one attack cannot apply the fourth debuff and apply the mark at the same time.\n\nThe 4 debuffs do not need to be applied by the same player, but a player holding a Death Mark must damage the enemy to mark it.\n\nThe duration of the mark is multiplied by the attack's proc coefficient, so damage-over-time debuffs can never apply the mark.\n\nThe duration of the mark cannot be extended or reset after it has been applied, but it can be reapplied as normal once it expires.\n\nOnce applied, the mark persists for its full duration even if the victim's debuffs expire such that it no longer has 4 debuffs.\n\nAll debuffs that can be applied to enemies count towards the activation requirement, including the   Clay

danger of being lost.\n\nIronically, the bombs themselves can also provide range with enough stacks of Egocentrism.\n\nWhile this can still result in a loss of movement items, this can offset the

by spending money on an Altar of Gold and then completing the Teleporter Event.Halcyon Beacons & Aurelionite[]\n     An unactivated Halcyon Beacon  \nScattered across the map are seven Halcyon Beacons, each costing gold to activate.\n\nHalcyon Beacons have a base cost of $25, equal to the cost of a Small Chest.\n\nThis cost scales over time with each stage like all other interactables.\n\nWhen the fourth Halcyon Beacon is activated, Aurelionite will spawn.\n\nWhile there are any inactive Beacons, Aurelionite is invulnerable to all damage.\n\nAfter a certain time passes, Aurelionite will deactivate all the Beacons, requiring the player to go through and buy them all again.\n\nBecause of this, a good strategy is to defeat many monsters before Aurelionite spawns to save up a lot of gold.\n\nDefeating Aurelionite will reward one Halcyon Seed per player and spawns a Gold Portal, allowing the players to leave the stage.\n\nChests[]\n     Chests Location  \nThere are four Small Chests that are guaranteed to spawn in set locations around the map.\n\nThe costs of these chests scale the same as other levels; however, their costs are not recalculated until the player finishes the next normal stage.\n\nThis means the cost multiplier carries over after the player leaves Gilded Coast and complete the next area.\n\nOne chest will spawn at each end of the half-buried ring structure, and the other two chests will spawn in the water nearby: one behind a tree, the other behind a fallen golem statue.\n\nLogbook Entry[]\n     Environment Log location  \nThe

equipment more closely resemble passive items; their benefits are present at all times while in a player's inventory.\n\nAs such, players cannot activate Elite equipment, and attempting to activate one does not incur a cooldown period or have a special effect.\n\nHowever, Elite equipment is still restricted to the active item slot, meaning they cannot be stacked and only one may be active at a time.\n\nDespite taking up an equipment slot, Engineer's turrets still carry on the effect of the item.\n\nAn Elite equipment can only be obtained as a rare (1/4000 or 0.025%) drop from its respective Elite monster, although this chance is affected by Luck.\n\nNote that Elite equipment appears as regular Orange Command Essence while the Artifact of Command is enabled, however the only option that will be presented is the elite of the enemy that dropped it.\n\nEven though they occupy the active item slot, Elite equipment are not subject to the effects of Artifact of Enigma, and will not change if \"used\" while it is enabled.\n\nThere are 7 Elite equipment, corresponding to the variations of Elite enemies.\n\nItem\n\nDescription\n\nElite\n\nHer Biting Embrace\n\nBecome an aspect of

Tougher Times, a frequently misunderstood and miscalculated item  \nAs players run through stages, they will collect Items from Chests and other sources.\n\nAs their run continues deeper and deeper, they will eventually find copies of items they've previously encountered.\n\nPicking up additional copies of an item is called \"stacking\" the item, and the total number of items of the same item is often called \"stacks\" of that item.\n\nAll items in the game (with the exception of equipment and  one special itemBeads of FealtySeems to do nothing... but...) have amplified effects when stacking.\n\nThe more stacks an item has, the more that effect is noticeable.\n\nFor example, a single  Paul's Goat HoofPaul's Goat HoofIncrease movement speed.Increases movement speed by 14% (+14%

two numerical variables that increase with stacking, but that variable is not always the same between items.\n\nFor example,  AtG Missile Mk.\n\n1AtG Missile Mk.\n\n1Chance to fire a missile.10%

240% base damage.\n\nboth have a chance to apply an effect that deal damage on a hit, but while stacking the former increases the damage of its effect, stacking the latter increases the chance of its effect occurring.\n\nThe effect of stacking on each item is described in the item's page.\n\nNote that for some items, the listed value in-game does not reflect the actual effect of the item.\n\nThis is especially true for items that stack non-linearly, as explained below.","metadata":{}}],["402",{"pageContent":"Item Stacking --------------\n\nThis is especially true for items that stack

types[]\nWhile many items stack in the way you would expect (having 3 items triples the effect, for example), many others do not.\n\nHowever, most items stack consistently in one of 3 ways, and scale in a similar manner to items of the same category.\n\nThese categories are outlined below.\n\nNote that a few items have several scaling statistics that use different scaling methods.\n\nThe  Fuel CellFuel CellHold an additional equipment charge.\n\nReduce equipment cooldown.Hold an additional equipment charge (+1 per stack).\n\nReduce equipment cooldown by 15% (+15% per stack)., for example, has both a linearly stacking (+1 charge per stack) and an exponentially stacking one (x0.85 equipment cooldown per stack).\n\nLinear Stacking[]\nMost items in the game stack linearly - meaning that for every added item, the bonus keeps increasing by the same base amount.\n\nFor example, the  Soldier's SyringeSoldier's SyringeIncrease attack speed.Increases attack speed by 15% (+15% per stack).\n\nincreases attack speed by +15%.\n\nHaving 2 of this item raises the bonus to +30%, and 10 of them to +150%.\n\nThe formula for an affected statistic is the linear function : \n\nf\n(\nx\n)\n=\n1\n+\na\n∙\nx\n\n{\\displaystyle f(x)=1+a\\bullet x}\n\n, where a is the effect of one item and x is the number of items.\n\nHyperbolic Stacking[]\n     Tougher times block rate per item  \nFor many items using percentages (mostly for control items or items that reduce a statistic), using linear stacking would eventually lead to a 100% chance of triggering or 100% reduction.\n\nThis would lead to wild imbalance from a design standpoint, such as becoming totally invulnerable or always stunning hit enemies.\n\nFor this reason, these items use a different type of scaling called hyperbolic stacking.\n\nThe formula for an affected statistic is the reciprocal function : \n\nf\n(\nx\n)\n=\n1\n−\n1\n\n/\n\n(\n1\n+\na\n∙\nx\n)\n\n{\\displaystyle f(x)=1-1/(1+a\\bullet x)}\n\n, where a is the effect of one item and x is the number of items.","metadata":{}}],["403",{"pageContent":"Item Stacking --------------\n\nThe formula for an affected statistic is the reciprocal function : \n\nf\n(\nx\n)\n=\n1\n−\n1\n\n/\n\n(\n1\n+\na\n∙\nx\n)\n\n{\\displaystyle f(x)=1-1/(1+a\\bullet x)}\n\n, where a is the effect of one item and x is the number of items.Tougher TimesTougher TimesChance to block incoming damage.15% (+15% per stack) chance to block incoming damage.\n\nUnaffected by luck.\n\nfor example, uses a = 0.15 -- so with 10 Tougher Times, the block chance would be equal to \n\n1\n−\n1\n\n/\n\n(\n1\n+\n0.15\n∙\n10\n)\n=\n1.5\n\n/\n\n2.5\n\n{\\displaystyle 1-1/(1+0.15\\bullet 10)=1.5/2.5}\n\n, or a 60% chance.\n\nOnce 223,696,201 Tougher Times are stacked, the block chance becomes 100% due to the limitations of floating point numbers.\n\nInterestingly, using this equation when x is 1, you end up with a 13.04% block chance as opposed to a 15% block chance.\n\nAn intuitive way of visualizing hyperbolic stacking is through a lottery example.\n\nImagine that there are green and red tickets in a box.\n\nEvery time the chance is tested, one ticket is drawn at random.\n\nIf it is green, the effect triggers, otherwise it does not.\n\nBy default, the box has 100 red tickets and no green tickets.\n\nEvery time an item is acquired, some green tickets are added to the box.\n\nOne Tougher Times would add 15 in this case.\n\nThe more green tickets are added, the more they are likely to be picked over red tickets.\n\nHowever, there is always a chance that a red ticket is picked instead, no matter how small.\n\nExponential Stacking[]\nSome items in the game are very powerful because of their exponential stacking, meaning that their stacking effects compound each other.\n\nFor instance, one stack of  Shaped GlassShaped GlassDouble your damage...\n\nBUT halve your health.Increase base damage by 100% (+100% per stack).\n\nReduce maximum health by 50% (+50% per stack).\n\ndoubles damage and halves health.\n\nAnother stack will double the new damage and halve the new health, meaning that final damage would be quadrupled instead of tripled, and final health would be divided by 4 instead of 2.\n\nThe formula for an affected statistic is the exponential function : \n\nf\n(\nx\n)\n=\n\na\n\nx\n\n{\\displaystyle f(x)=a^{x}}\n\n, where a is the effect of one item and x is the number of items.","metadata":{}}],["404",{"pageContent":"Item Stacking --------------\n\nThe formula for an affected statistic is the exponential function : \n\nf\n(\nx\n)\n=\n\na\n\nx\n\n{\\displaystyle f(x)=a^{x}}\n\n, where a is the effect of one item and x is the number of items.The power of exponential stacking is that unlike both other types of stacking, they do not suffer from diminishing returns since their effects are compounding.\n\nFor example, going from 50 to 51 stacks of  Soldier's SyringeSoldier's SyringeIncrease attack speed.Increases attack speed by 15% (+15% per stack).\n\nwould raise the attack speed bonus from +750% to +765%, which is a negligible increase.\n\nSimilarly, going from 50 to 51  Tougher TimesTougher TimesChance to block incoming damage.15% (+15% per stack) chance to block incoming damage.\n\nUnaffected by luck.\n\nwould increase block chance from 88.2% to 88.4%, which leads to an increase in expected survivability of about 1.7%.\n\nBy contrast, going from 50 to 51  Shaped GlassShaped GlassDouble your damage...\n\nBUT halve your health.Increase base damage by 100% (+100% per stack).\n\nReduce maximum health by 50% (+50% per stack).\n\nwould still double an already monstrously high damage and halve a ridiculously low health.\n\nSpecial Stacking[]\nThe  BandolierBandolierChance on kill to drop an ammo pack that resets all skill cooldowns.18% (+10% per stack) chance on kill to drop an ammo pack that resets all skill cooldowns.\n\nuses its own special stacking formula close to hyperbolic stacking - the drop rate of an ammo box is equal to \n\n1\n−\n1\n\n/\n\n(\n1\n+\nx\n\n)\n\n0.33\n\n{\\displaystyle 1-1/(1+x)^{0.33}}\n\n, where x is equal to the number of Bandoliers.\n\nWhile this looks like other hyperbolic stacking items, the nature of the 0.33 exponent means that the first couple Bandoliers will have a huge impact on drop chance, while the following ones will rise very slowly.\n\nMore detailed information on the Bandolier's stacking can be found on its dedicated page.\n\nStacking limits[]\nAll items can be stacked infinitely (at least up to the signed 32-bit integer cap of 2,147,483,647), and their effects will also stack accordingly.\n\nHowever, some items have an effective limit after which further stacks have no effect.","metadata":{}}],["405",{"pageContent":"Item Stacking --------------\n\nHowever, some items have an effective limit after which further stacks have no

carrying several bags of fertilizer, and she gave him a quizzical look.\n\n“You need any help with those?” She said, gathering her clipboard for her check.\n\n“Oh no, I’m alright.\n\nIt’s a good workout, actually,” he said.\n\nAs they walked, the botanist couldn’t help but wonder what kind of job would require THAT much fertilizer.\n\nAs the door to the greenhouse whirred open, she got her answer – roots scaling the height of the greenhouse and snaking along the ceiling, even invading the containers of other specimens.\n\n“What the hell!\n\n?” She cried, her jaw slack.\n\nAnd then she noticed the other plants.\n\nEvery other plant in the greenhouse had withered – with an incriminating root leading back to the overgrowth that the worker was now feeding fertilizer.\n\nThe botanist was speechless.\n\n“What happened...?\n\nWhat... what is that...?” She stammered.\n\nThe worker turned to her and grinned.\n\n“One of the species we got in the last expedition.\n\nHe demands a lot of nutrients - it took me so long to get him to even sprout.\n\nI was wracking my brain, trying every trick in the book.\n\nAnd every other specimen seemed to be growing fine, so I figured, hey, why not share some of that?\n\nAnd look!”\n\nSpreading his arms, the worker marveled at the gallery of dead plants.\n\nDropping her clipboard, the botanist’s stomach sank.\n\nThings were no longer looking up.","metadata":{}}],["413",{"pageContent":"Lens-Maker's Glasses --------------\n\n\n\nLens-Maker's Glasses\n\nGain 10% chance for hits to 'Critically Strike', dealing double damage.\n\nYour attacks

halving attack speed per stack is incorrect.\n\nOnly the first stack reduces attack speed by half; subsequent stacks have a lower penalty.\n\nBecause the Light Flux Pauldron's modification applies after all other changes, it makes attack speed bonuses less effective, and offers less of a cooldown reduction in the presence of other items that provide cooldown reductions.\n\nAfter applying the attack speed penalty, the game checks whether the value is less than 0.1 and sets it to that.\n\nTherefore, 9+ stacks will have the same effect on attack speed, assuming a starting value of

a reference to Risk of Rain 1, as it has the same color scheme as the original Loader.\n\nIt may also be a reference to the Power Loader suit in the movie Alien.\n\nThe Loader in Risk of Rain 2 is female, while the Loader in Risk of Rain 1 is male.\n\nDue to being immune to fall damage, the Artifact of Frailty has no effect on Loader.\n\nContrary to her game description, Loader is one of the most mobile survivors in the game.\n\nLoader is often considered the most powerful early-game and overall character in game due to her survivability, burst power, mobility, and low reliance on items.\n\nLoader’s lore entry states that her suit is capable of lifting 250 tons, that is the equivalent of 71 elephants, or 125 cars.\n\nMeaning she is technically hitting enemies with the force of 71 elephants, this also doesn’t account for momentum, as her Charged Gauntlet ability gets stronger with momentum and speed\nMoving at 300mph (the requirements to complete Loader: Earthshatter) would be the equivalent of being hit by a Bugatti Chiron Super Sport, a special calculator found out that if moving at 300 mph whilst using Charged Gauntlet would amount to 2000 tons of force, which is

this encounter.\n\n* The name of “Vagrant” was decided on by its nomadic nature.\n\nWe trailed a lone specimen for several days.\n\nThe Vagrant would wander from place to place, occasionally dipping down towards the ground to feel around with its tentacles.\n\nAfter a few minutes, it would ascend and continue on its path.\n\nCould the Vagrant be looking for something, indicating intelligence, or is this merely a hunting method?\n\n* When the clouds part, dozens of Vagrants can be seen lazily drifting throughout the sky, twinkling like stars.\n\nDespite their beauty, it raises a horrifying question – are the stars at night on this planet truly stars, or just more Vagrants?\n\nThe answer can spell truly horrifying implications for our stay on this planet.\n\nXi

fast combos and negates the endlag of the third strike.\n\nThis is most valuable when combined with Mercenary's utility skills, allowing the player to Expose a long line of enemies or deal great burst damage to them.\n\nIt can also be used with Eviscerate to deal more damage to the targeted enemy.\n\nWhirlwind can be used on slanted edges or ramps to launch Mercenary vertically, gaining a large

in a similar manner using Rising Thunder, which knocks the enemy upwards.\n\nHowever, this force is not enough to move medium or large enemies.\n\nBlinding Assault can be canceled mid-dash by using either Whirlwind or Rising Thunder, shortening the length of the dash.\n\nThis is useful primarily to avoid overshooting or in order to precisely end a dash for, say, a slam (the tip

enemies that are immediate threats, but also remember to flee if things get dicey.Do not constantly rely on Mercenary's invincibility frames to completely negate damage; stay dodgy and avoid being hit altogether when possible.\n\nAlthough Whirlwind is smoother and easier to combo with than Rising Thunder, Rising Thunder itself has higher damage output (550% compared to Whirlwind's 400%) and can be more adaptive with dodges due to its quick vertical movement.\n\nNotably, only Mercenary benefits from hitting an Exposed enemy.\n\nIf a non-Mercenary character or ally hits an Exposed enemy, the Exposed is not removed and the ally does not deal more damage or get cooldown reduction.\n\nWhen fighting bosses, Mercenary can stay safely in the air above their heads for a very long time by chaining together Whirlwind→Eviscerate→Whirlwind along with Laser Sword attacks and double jumps.\n\nLaser Sword also has a slight vacuum effect and can be used to stick to and strafe around larger enemies.\n\nMercenary actually receives downsides from having bonus attack speed, narrowing the window to perform Laser Sword extensions and shortening the distance that Whirlwind and Rising Thunder move him.\n\nAttack speed can still be useful as it shortens the cast time of his skills and gives additional Eviscerate hits, but these losses should be taken into consideration as well.\n\nBoth

twice or combo Whirlwind + Laser Sword before needing to dash again.\n\nThere is also just enough time to use Eviscerate or Slicing Winds between Blinding Assaults, if used immediately without any delay between dashes.\n\nDue to the effectiveness of Blinding Assault, and with a bit of finesse Focused Assault, the player can maintain permanent invulnerability with only their utility.\n\nWith enough skill, this effectively eliminates the need to use Eviscerate, except maybe for an extra dash.\n\nSome bosses have heads which act as solid platforms, which the Mercenary can stand on to fight the boss without as much danger from enemies below.\n\nSlicing Winds is a very effective single-target and area-of-effect tool for Mercenary, as it has a higher general damage output than Eviscerate, as well as inflicting Expose at the end of the skill.\n\nSlicing Winds totals 1150% (800% + 350% from Expose) damage on a single target and up to 3450% total damage against 3 targets (1150%x3 targets, as it can Expose those 3 targets).\n\nBy comparison, Eviscerate is only 770% total damage to a single target, and is not really able to properly hit multiple targets at once.\n\nAlthough Eviscerate

Lemurian's fire breath\nThe intent here is to make it clear to the player what exactly a burn DOES, regardless of how it's applied.Players never were told by the game that burning actually stacks.\n\nIf you have a certain number of burn stacks, you will now be aware of exactly how much that will hit for.\n\nOverall this should make the burns way less bursty and way more consistent, also allowing heal over time effects to help counteract the damage.\n\nThe intent is NOT to make the entire game easier, or to make burns never kill you.\n\nFire elites are the only purely offensive elite-type, so they should be causing deaths.\n\nIt should just feel less BS now.\n\n**Ice Elites**Glacial (Affix Buff) Gain the power of a Glacial Elite.Leave an ice explosion on death, and apply an 80% slow on hit.\n\nRework ice bomb\nImprove graphics for ice bomb left when killed to be more clear.\n\nIce bomb damage reduced from 350% to 150%\nIce bomb damage is no longer reduced at the edge of the radius\nIce bomb now FREEZES characters in the radius for 1.5s\n*Fire elites have always been the most threatening type, with the other 2 being pretty easy.\n\nThe hope here is that after the nerf of the Fire affix, the Ice affix can now also be respected as a serious threat.\n\nThe improved visuals should help clarify what the ice affix actually does - most players don't seem to notice it drops a bomb at all.\n\nWe're starting with a low freeze duration to test how it feels.\n\n*\n  **Lightning Elites**Overloading (Affix Buff) Gain the power of an Overloading Elite.Attacks explode after a delay.\n\n50% of health is replaced by shield.\n\nLightning bombs from Lightning Elites now properly attach to players.\n\nLightning elites now always spawn at full shields\nImprove lightning bomb graphics\nBug Fixes\nUpdate Elite naming for localization and appearance in pings\n\nTrivia[]\nMonsters can get stuck on a Shrine of Combat or Shrine of Chance, where they then jump up and down repeatedly, dance around it, or stand completely still.","metadata":{}}],["595",{"pageContent":"Monsters --------------\n\nIt is only available if the DLC is enabled when starting a run.Click for more

damaged.\n\nThe Soul Energy value cannot exceed the holder's full combined health (max health plus max shields).\n\nGiven the item's high rate of fire, this is usually not a problem, however.\n\nAdditionally, once the player's Soul Energy accumulates enough to activate N'kuhana's Opinion, it will deplete Soul Energy and attempt to fire, even if no enemies are in range.\n\nThis makes it impossible to stockpile more than one second's worth of attacks, no matter how much healing the player has.\n\nTips[]\nN'kuhana's Opinion is uniquely one of the only items that does not use

fewer item procs, so it's important to keep any flat healing up to scratch to keep N'kuhana's up to speed (and for the holder to avoid dying, as is typical of any run).\n\nPercentage-based healing,

Generally, Corposebloom is a downgrade if the user can reliably and continuously heal above 10% max health per second.\n\nUniquely, because Corpsebloom steals and then releases all healing itself, it ignores the restrictions of on-hit healing triggered by skulls.\n\nThis means a skull can activate on-hit healing, and since Corpsebloom is the item providing the final healing, it will count towards the Soul Energy value where it would normally be filtered out.\n\nThis means one could theoretically have an infinite loop of consistent, if slow, N'Kahuna's skulls and healing, though this is

more vigorously when Collapse is about to deal damage.\n\nIf an enemy dies before Collapse deals damage, the circle will remain at the position where it died.\n\nBecause Collapse is a debuff, the damage dealt has a proc coefficient of 0.0.\n\nTips[]\nThe corruption of Tri-Tip Daggers is inconsequential if the player has a high critical strike chance paired with the Shatterspleen, effectively allowing for both debuffs from Tri-Tip Daggers and Needleticks to apply simultaneously.\n\nOne stack of Bleed deals a total of 240% base damage over 3 seconds, while one stack of Collapse deals 400% base damage after 3 seconds.\n\nWhile this may make Collapse appear strictly better on paper, it is worth considering how these debuffs behave when a new stack is inflicted: all stacks of Bleed have their durations refreshed when an additional new stack is inflicted, while all Collapse stacks expire at once after the 3-second countdown begins.\n\nAs a result, if the player has enough Tri-Tip Daggers and hit rate to repeatedly reset Bleed stacks, Bleed will outperform Collapse, especially in long fights.\n\nHowever, the Needletick is still useful at low stacks when resetting Bleed would be unlikely, or for Survivors with very low hit rate (although such Survivors might benefit more from scrapping Tri-Tip Daggers altogether).\n\nIf the player has a Shatterspleen, the Tri-Tip Dagger

Meagerly defended and built mostly out of empty cargo containers, it was a doomed attempt by the survivors to endure the relentless onslaught of the planet's denizens.\n\nIt does appear that they were able to hold out for some period of time, given the survivors' ability to construct the signature radio tower located in the cliffs above the camp and the presence of the damaged yet repairable TC-280 Prototype, a formidable and heavily-armed Drone.\n\nBy the time the Survivors of the UES Safe Travels happen upon it, Rallypoint Delta is long-abandoned and mostly buried within the snow.\n\nGiven the usage of 'delta' in its name, it can be assumed that Rallypoint Delta was one of several locations established by the survivors.\n\nMonsters[]\n  Bighorn BisonBighorn BisonHP: 480 (+144 per

mentions a turbine, presumably the Laser Turbine, and indicates that the Resonance Disc was to be sent to the same mailing address as the Laser Turbine.\n\nBefore the Anniversary Update, the math for Resonance Disc was more complex.\n\nWhile holding the Resonance Disc, kills generates 2.5 spin, visible by the dot in the model flying around.\n\nSpin decays over time.\n\nEvery 1/60th of a second, Spin = previous spin - (1.25 * time since last kill in seconds).\n\nIn short, spin decays faster the more time passes between kills.\n\nSpin, in turn, generates charge.\n\nCharge does not decay.\n\nAt 100% charge, the Resonance Disc checks all enemies within the blast radius of its nearest target to see if it can hit more enemies by targeting one of them instead.","metadata":{}}],["721",{"pageContent":"REX --------------\n\n\n\nREX\n\nREX is a half robot / half plant that uses HP to cast devastating skills from a distance.\n\nThe plant nor the robot

not halve the overall stat value but have a diminishing effect.\n\nTips[]\nFor most characters and builds, keep in mind that the movement speed penalty of Stone Flux Pauldron will generally be far more troublesome than the accompanying health bonus is worth.\n\nThe vast majority of enemy attacks come in the form of close-range melee, projectiles with a travel time, and telegraphed area-of-effect attacks.\n\nAll these attacks also generally will not track a moving player and instead lag behind.\n\nAs such, the loss of one's ability to effectively dodge these attacks and/or flee

could have otherwise avoided.Often, the player may end up taking far more damage than the extra health of the Pauldron can defend them from.\n\nThis speed penalty also complicates one's ability to get around each stage in order to search for interactables, and as such, might make it difficult to keep up with the time-based scaling of the game's difficulty.\n\nThis may be exacerbated in multiplayer games, where a player with one or more Stone Flux Pauldron(s) could have trouble getting to chests and other sources of items before the faster player(s) can pick the stage clean.\n\nThe

notable quirk revealed by the exceptionally low movement speeds possible by stacking Stone Flux Pauldrons is the fact that a player's friction with the ground is directly tied to their movement speed.\n\nAs such, stacking many Pauldrons will make the player incredibly slippery, making it rather difficult to manage the knockback caused by enemy attacks (especially explosions like the   Jellyfish'sJellyfishHP: 60 (+18 per level)Damage: 5 (+1 per level)Class: Self-DestructSpeed: 10 m/sArmor: 0 self-detonation) or the recoil from their own skills (such as Survivors of the Void - DLC

their momentum in mid-air, should they need to.\n\nThe item's extra effect of negating all fall damage is also especially helpful in this scenario: The player's low traction and reliance on less-controllable means of movement will make falling off of ledges much more common, and fall damage is calculated as a percentage of the player's health, making it hit harder for high-health players.\n\nOn all survivors, jumping without providing any directional input (WASD/movement stick) will completely halt any non-vertical momentum.\n\nThis gives a player with several Stone Flux Pauldrons a consistent means to slow down without having to rely on their immensely reduced friction, so long as they are on the ground to start with.\n\nThe Stone Flux Pauldron's health boost synergizes best with items and abilities that benefit from the player taking damage, help the extra health last longer, aid with healing, and/or scale positively with the player's maximum
